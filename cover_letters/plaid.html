          Hi, I’m Abdulhakeem. You can call me Hakeem. I have experience building full-stack applications in many
          languages and
          frameworks. What I’ve learned
          over time is that the main mental challenge often lies in the logic behind what you're building, and not in
          the
          language/framework itself.
        </p>

        <p>
          Outside of work, I enjoy painting, playing volleyball, soccer, scuba diving, and hanging out with friends. I
          also
          enjoy
          reading about business and finance.
        </p>

      I'm a good fit for this software engineering position at Plaid for many reasons, including the following 3:
    </p>

    <hr>
    <p>
      1.<span class="u-background-plaid-colors">I have software engineering experience</span>.
      <br> <br>
      That is where I’ve been working at Fiskkit as a part-time full-stack software
      engineer for about 1 year now. I'm used to working on the full-stack, and on taking responsibility for the full
      life-cycle of features. I've gotten the chance to take full responsibility for leading many features while there,
      including mobile responsiveness of the entire website, email confirmation, and email notifications (current). (The tech
      stack of Fiskkit is Docker, MySQL, Laravel, React, and Redux.)
      <br> <br>
      Moreover, I have completed full-time 6 months of the Public Investment Fund (PIF) Graduate Development Program (GDP) so far. During my time here, I got the chance to learn about / work with Linux OS server administration 
      (with Red Hat), Windows OS server administration (with Microsoft), networking (with CompTIA), virtualization (with VMware), 
      cybersecurity (with CompTIA), and computer hacking (with EC-Council).
      <br> <br>
      I'm currently interning at NEOM with the technology team (as an extension of the PIF GD Program).
    </p>
    
    <hr>
    <p>
      2. <span class="u-background-plaid-colors">I have great communication skills</span>. 
      <br> <br>
      That is where I got the chance to sharpen those skills during my 1 year working as
      a Communication Representative at the Ettihad Cultural Center at Oregon State University, 4 months of intensive,
     pair programming at App Academy, and during the Executive Education training at UC Berkeley.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <p>
      3. <span class="u-background-plaid-colors">I have experience with test-driven development</span>.
      <br> <br>
      I wrote all of the integration tests (35 specs) for
      <a href="https://github.com/Hakeemmidan/poll-app">this project</a>
      using Mocha, Chai, and a mock in-memory database. 
      (<a href="https://github.com/Hakeemmidan/poll-app/tree/dev/server/test">Link to the specs</a>)
      I completed this project with 2 other developers and a
      team lead as part of Hatchways' co-op program. My team lead during that time (4-weeks) was the CTO of Hatchways and
      former CTO of Blynkstyle (acquired by Kik). I learned a great deal from them in terms of project management and software
      engineering leadership in general. I also have some experience with RSpec and Capybara (for Rails testing). And I'm sure
      that picking up other TDD frameworks will not be a problem.
